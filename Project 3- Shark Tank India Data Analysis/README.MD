## Business Objectives :

Shark Tank India is an Indian franchise of the original American hit reality show, “Shark Tank”. The premise is simple, entrepreneurs pitch their ideas for businesses or products to a panel of potential investors, the “Sharks”. The panellists themselves are self-made multi-millionaires who analyse the business models and products. Depending on the proposed venture, the Sharks will decide whether or not to invest their own money in marketing and mentoring the contestants.
